    """Translates a SMILES into a SELFIES.

    The SMILES to SELFIES translation occurs independently of the SELFIES
    alphabet and grammar. Thus, :func:`selfies.encoder` will work regardless of
    the alphabet and grammar rules that :py:mod:`selfies` is operating on,
    assuming the input is a valid SMILES. Additionally, :func:`selfies.encoder`
    preserves the atom and branch order of the input SMILES; thus, one
    could generate random SELFIES corresponding to the same molecule by
    generating random SMILES, and then translating them.

    However, encoding and then decoding a SMILES may not necessarily yield
    the original SMILES. Reasons include:

        1.  SMILES with aromatic symbols are automatically
            Kekulized before being translated.
        2.  SMILES that violate the bond constraints specified by
            :mod:`selfies` will be successfully encoded by
            :func:`selfies.encoder`, but then decoded into a new molecule
            that satisfies the constraints.
        3.  The exact ring numbering order is lost in :func:`selfies.encoder`,
            and cannot be reconstructed by :func:`selfies.decoder`.

    Finally, note that :func:`selfies.encoder` does **not** check if the input
    SMILES is valid, and should not be expected to reject invalid inputs.
    It is recommended to use RDKit to first verify that the SMILES are
    valid.

    :param smiles: the SMILES to be translated.
    :param print_error: if True, error messages will be printed to console.
        Defaults to False.
    :return: the SELFIES translation of ``smiles``. If an error occurs,
        and ``smiles`` cannot be translated, :code:`None` is returned instead.

    :Example:

    >>> import selfies
    >>> selfies.encoder('C=CF')
    '[C][=C][F]'

    .. note:: Currently, :func:`selfies.encoder` does not support the
        following types of SMILES:

        *   SMILES using ring numbering across a dot-bond symbol
            to specify bonds, e.g. ``C1.C2.C12`` (propane) or
            ``c1cc([O-].[Na+])ccc1`` (sodium phenoxide).
        *   SMILES with ring numbering between atoms that are over
            ``16 ** 3 = 4096`` atoms apart.
        *   SMILES using the wildcard symbol ``*``.
        *   SMILES using chiral specifications other than ``@`` and ``@@``.
